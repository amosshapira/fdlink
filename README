This Linux 2.6.* kernel module adds /dev/flink device which accepts a ioctl
with an open file descriptor and a non-existing path name and will link
the given name to the passed file descriptor IF the name doesn't exist AND
the file pointed to by the file descriptor resides on the same file system
as the given path.

Pay attention not to confuse that the ioctl(2) call is done on the fd of
/dev/flink but the passed file descriptor is in a field of the struct
pointed to by "arg".

To install run "make" and "sudo insmod flink_dev.ko"

To test run "runtest".

See source of flinkapp (flinkapp.c) for an example for using the flink()
function call, or just use the application from the comand line.
